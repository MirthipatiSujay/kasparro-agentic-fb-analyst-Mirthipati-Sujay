This repository is a minimal, runnable implementation of the assignment:
- It implements Planner, DataAgent, InsightAgent, EvaluatorAgent, CreativeGenerator
- Uses the provided sample dataset at `data/sample_dataset.csv`
- Run the analysis with: `python run.py "Analyze ROAS drop"`

Files created:
- reports/report.md
- reports/insights.json
- reports/creatives.json
- logs/run_log.json

This sample is intentionally compact but demonstrates the agentic architecture, validation, and creative generation.
